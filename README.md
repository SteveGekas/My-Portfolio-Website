# My-Portfolio-Website

## Description 

Using my files from the previous portfolio files, I used more HTML and CSS to add my linkedIn profile, github account and resume in PDF form to allow for downloading.


If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).


## Installation

I uploaded all of the files that I have changed to Github.  To make sure everything worked to my wants, I ran my files through Github pages to verify that everything I added or changed worked.

## Usage 

Each page of my website is responsive to where if you shrink each page, the images, paragraphs etc. all shrink or grow with whatever device you are using.  (Desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.) 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

md
![about-me](assets/images/about-me/)

md
![my-portfolio](assets/images/my-portfolio/)

md
![contact-me](assets/images/contact-me/)
