# My-Portfolio-Website

## Description 

I created index, portfolio and contact HTML page.   While working in these pages, I was checking on Google Chrome to see if it was what I wanted.  I also created a style and reset css to go with the bootstrap framework.

## Installation

Uploaded all my files to GitHub.  Launched website from GitHub to make sure everything was in order.

## Usage 

Each page of my website is responsive to where if you shrink each page, the images, paragraphs etc. all shrink or grow with whatever device you are using.  (Desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.) 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshots/)
```
